<h1>That's me!!!!</h1>
    <p>
    Welcome to my blog! This is Lingua, <em>the real name of </em>whom, <strong> knows.</strong> Here are some clues to know me better.
    </p>

    <p>
        By the way, <em>why on earth would you like to know me</em>??? If I were someone else, I wouldn't want to <strong>know me </strong>for example.
    </p>

    <p>Let's talk about ordered and unordered list. I will do that by using ol here.
        <ol type="I">
            <li>First of all, the order of the things I'll tell you is important. </li> 
            <li>For example if I put this item into the first place it would be <em>weird.</em></li>
            <li>Still, the question is: Would I have used <strong>unordered list</strong> here instead of ordered list? I think yes. Because, using ul doesn't necessarily mean that order is not important at all, but in <em>ol</em> items should be crucially listed in order.</li> 
            <li>Anyway, imagine this part just with ul in that you would compare it. I can help you in that; just click <a href= "/ullist/index.html">HERE</a>.</li>
        </ol>

    <p>Ok now let's see the image which is <strong>really </strong>relevant right now.
